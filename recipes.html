    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <ul class="lasagna"> 
      <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
      <li>Pasta sheets</li>
      <li>Olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
      <li>750g beef mince</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>White sauce</li>
      <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="container">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
     <p>Step 1
        To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
        </p>
      <p>Step 2
        Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
      </p> 
      <p>Step 3
        Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
      </p> 
       <p> Step 4
        Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
      </p> 
       <p>Step 5
        Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
      </p> 
       <p>Step 6
        Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
      </p>  
        <p>Step 7
        Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can’t see any pasta poking through.
      </p>
       <p>Step 8
        Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
      </p>
       <p>Step 9
        Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.

        Bring 2 1/2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until grains are tender and water has been absorbed, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
